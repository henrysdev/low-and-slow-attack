[ OVERVIEW ]
The goal of any DOS attacks is the same: To completely exhaust the target server's resources. While traditional DOS attacks often accomplish this by flooding servers with huge ammounts of incoming traffic, low and slow attacks use a much sneakier method of action. Low and slow attacks such as "Slow Loris" gradually exhaust a server's resources by continuously opening and maintaining new connections with the server. Given that a server has a limit to the amount of concurrent connections it can handle simultaneously, the server will eventually be unable to handle any new connections, denying availability to legitimate visitors to the website.


[ COMPILATION ]
gcc -o attack slowloris.c


[ EXECUTION ]
./attack <IP_ADDRESS> <MAX_CONNECTIONS>

where IP_ADDRESS is the address of the web server you wish to target, and MAX_CONNECTIONS is the limit of how many connections to spawn with the server.


[ NOTES ]
A scripting language such as Python would be a more practical choice for an implementation language for this kind of attack. However, this project was created purely for learning purposes.
