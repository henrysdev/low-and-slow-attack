Slow Loris Denial of Service Attack

Disclaimer: I neither condone nor intend for this program to be used for malicious purposes. Please only run this program on websites that you own or have permission to test on.


OVERVIEW
The goal of any DOS attacks is the same: To completely exhaust the target server's resources. While traditional DOS attacks often accomplish this by flooding servers with huge ammounts of incoming traffic, low and slow attacks use a much sneakier method of action.

Low and slow attacks such as "Slow Loris" and "RUDY" (r u dead yet) slowly exhaust a server's resources by repeatedly opening new connections with the server. Given that a server has a limit to the amount of concurrent connections it can handle simultaneously, the server will eventually be unable to handle any new connections, denying availability to legitimate visitors to the website.

COMPILATION
gcc -o slowloris.c slowloris

EXECUTION
./slowloris <WEBSITE_ADDRESS> <MAX_CONNECTIONS>

WEBSITE_ADDRESS is the URL or address of the website you wish to target.
MAX_CONNECTIONS is the limit of how many connections to spawn with the server.
